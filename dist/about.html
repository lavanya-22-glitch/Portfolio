        <h2 class="sub-head">Get to Know Me</h2>

        <p>I'm Lavanya Bhadani, a B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at IIT Patna. I chose this branch because of its immense future potential â€” AI is transforming every industry, and I'm especially fascinated by how it mimics human behavior. I've always been curious about the inner workings of intelligent systems, and one of my long-term dreams is to build my own humanoid.</p>
        <p>My coding journey began back in 10th grade. What started as a school requirement soon became a genuine interest. Since then, I've explored various areas of development and enjoyed building projects that solve everyday problems. I work on both the frontend and backend of websites â€” the creative challenges of frontend design appeal to me just as much as the logical depth of backend development.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm learning about the applications of Python in machine learning and data science, and I hope to integrate these skills into my own projects. When I face difficulties or bugs, I like to revisit the core concepts by using tools like ChatGPT or Perplexity to get concise explanations. This helps me understand problems deeply and come up with my own solutions.</p>
        <p>I'm especially drawn to building apps and websites that are simple, user-friendly, and utility-focused â€” tools that make people's lives just a bit easier. Outside the tech world, I enjoy playing basketball, swimming, chess, and writing poems. I also participate in public speaking and JAM sessions, and have taken up roles as an adjudicator in competitions.</p>
        <p>I'd describe myself as cheerful, motivated, observant, and someone who's always eager to learn and improve.</p>
