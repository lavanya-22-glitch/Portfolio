            <p>I built Talika because my sticky notes and half-filled planners just weren't cutting it. I needed a digital space that felt clean, simple, and peaceful — something made for students like me juggling tasks every day.
            Talika is made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a soft lavender theme and a focus on easy usability. It's my little productivity tool — and building it taught me a lot about frontend structure, interactive design, and clean UI thinking.
            I made it solo, and I'm proud of how far it's come. Someday, I'd love to give it a backend and maybe even smart features. But for now, it does what I built it for — helps me breathe and stay on track.</p>

            <h3 class="title-blog">🌱 Why I Started Coding (And Why I'm Still Here)</h3>

            <p>I didn't plan to be a coder — it started in class 10 as just another subject. But something about writing logic and seeing it come to life on screen felt… exciting.
            Over time, I built things I actually needed — a quiz app for a fest, a task manager to organize my chaos, a weather app just because I could. I enjoy both the creativity of frontend and the logic of backend — they challenge different parts of me.
            Even when I get stuck, I love the process of figuring it out (with help from tools like ChatGPT). Coding has become my space to think, create, and solve. And I'm here to keep building — one project at a time.</p>

            <h3 class="title-blog">🔮 What's Next: Learning, Building, Growing</h3>

            <p>I'm currently exploring Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning, excited by how AI can solve real problems. I hope to use these skills to make smarter, more helpful apps — maybe even improve the ones I've already built, like Talika and Suchita.
            The journey hasn't always been easy, but I've had help — from mentors, teammates, and tools like ChatGPT. Every bug taught me something, and every fix pushed me forward.
            I may be at the beginning, but I'm here to keep learning, keep building, and dream a little bigger each time.</p>
